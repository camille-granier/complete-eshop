# Complete e-shop Project

This project is using the [fakestore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) to display products and build a fake e-commerce.
It has been developed with the help of [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSXA2XluIBU&t=768s)

## Technologies

I used React, Bootstrap, and other react libraries including react-redux (used to manage Cart state), authContext to manage authentication, using firebase Auth.


## Hosting

This project has been deployed with Firebase, you can find it [here](https://complete-e-shop.web.app).
