# Complete e-shop Project

This project is using the [fakestore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) to display products and build a fake e-commerce.

## Technologies

I used React, Bootstrap, and other react libraries including react-redux (used to manage Cart state), authContext to manage authentication, using firebase Auth.
